Chapter 1 - A Helicopter View
==============

# 1.1 Why Systems Science:  The State of Knowledge and Understanding
* **Knowledge**
    * There are over 100M non-fiction books & ~20x that in journal article publications.
    * Then consider how much other forms of media humans have produced.
    * How much of this constitues real human knowledge?
    * If we have all of this knowledge, why do we still have so many problems?
        * global population heading towards 9B people
        * food and water supply threats
        * climate change
        * dwindling natural resources
    * "If we really understood how the world works, would this be the case?" (p 4).
    * Maybe our knowledge is incomplete, or perhaps we haven't fully understood the "whole" despite having knowledge of the "parts". (Now we're getting into systems...)
* **Science**
    * Science is about gaining useful knowledge, but has largely been about the parts.
    * Example:  Consider the improvements in our transportation and communication systems, but what about the consequences of globalization in every area of life?
* **Why do we need systems science?**
    * To go deeper into more areas of components of a system
    * See borders & places of meeting & transition
    * Follow complex dynamics of how components function together relative to each other that cannot be captured individually 
* **Systems science is a meta science**
    * "meta" Greek for "beyond"
    * We have major forms of science: physics, chemistry, biology, etc., each with their own subfields. 
    * Systems science goes beyond the boundaries of any particular science to include them all.
    * Consider physics and chemistry-- systems science would allow us to understand the relationship between the two, or how they relate to biology.
* **Whole systems thinking**
    * Developed over the last 75 years (relative to 2015) to discover connectedness of things that seem to be unconnected
    * Tools for exploring wholeness & interrelatedness
   * The book is about a metascience, looking at parts of the world in a way that in unifying & explanatory.
    * Shows how to integrate knowledge of other sciences & provide them meaningful guidance.
* **Systems**
    * "Virtually everything in the universe, including the universe itself, is a system!"
    * Systems are composed of systems
    * Both fascinating & critical to our lives is understanding the world system, life system, and socioeconomic systems; we are participants in each of these systems.

# 1.2 The Distinctive Potential of Systems Science
* **Definition and Scope**  
    * Systems science applies universally to everything in the universe.  
    * It does not replace traditional scientific disciplines but offers a complementary approach.  
* **Traditional Sciences vs. Systems Science**  
    * **Traditional Sciences**  
        * Specialize in specific fields and do not easily cross disciplinary boundaries.  
        * Use reductionist approaches—breaking subjects into smaller parts for analysis.  
        * Reconstruct whole systems from analyzed parts within a specific discipline.  
    * **Systems Science**  
        * Follows relational networks outward, leading to greater inclusivity.  
        * Views boundaries as transitions to more comprehensive systemic levels.  
        * Complements reductionist methods rather than replacing them.  
        * Addresses complex multi-causal environmental and social problems.  
* **Systems Science and Relationship Networks**  
    * Every scientific discipline studies relationships within its subject matter.  
    * Systems science focuses on the broader principles governing relational systems.  
    * Interaction between systems science and specialized disciplines enhances understanding.  
    * Disciplinary knowledge provides valuable insights that contribute to systems thinking.  
* **Contribution of Systems Science**  
    * Facilitates communication between highly specialized disciplines.  
    * Functions like syntax in linguistics—revealing shared structures across diverse fields.  
    * Bridges natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  
    * Helps address interdisciplinary challenges and complex systemic problems.  
* **Nature of Systems Science**  
    * Not a single, unified field but a collection of interrelated conceptual frameworks.  
    * Aims to consolidate frameworks into a general theory of systems.  
    * Provides scientific tools for studying natural objects as systems.
