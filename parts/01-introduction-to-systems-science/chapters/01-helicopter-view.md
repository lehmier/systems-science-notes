Chapter 1 - A Helicopter View
==============

# 1.1 Why Systems Science:  The State of Knowledge and Understanding
* **Knowledge**
    * There are over 100M non-fiction books & ~20x that in journal article publications.
    * Then consider how much other forms of media humans have produced.
    * How much of this constitutes real human knowledge?
    * If we have all of this knowledge, why do we still have so many problems?
        * global population heading towards 9B people
        * food and water supply threats
        * climate change
        * dwindling natural resources
    * "If we really understood how the world works, would this be the case?" (p 4).
    * Maybe our knowledge is incomplete, or perhaps we haven't fully understood the "whole" despite having knowledge of the "parts". (Now we're getting into systems...)
* **Science**
    * Science is about gaining useful knowledge, but has largely been about the parts.
    * Example:  Consider the improvements in our transportation and communication systems, but what about the consequences of globalization in every area of life?
* **Why do we need systems science?**
    * To go deeper into more areas of components of a system
    * See borders & places of meeting & transition
    * Follow complex dynamics of how components function together relative to each other that cannot be captured individually 
* **Systems science is a meta science**
    * "meta" Greek for "beyond"
    * We have major forms of science: physics, chemistry, biology, etc., each with their own subfields. 
    * Systems science goes beyond the boundaries of any particular science to include them all.
    * Consider physics and chemistry-- systems science would allow us to understand the relationship between the two, or how they relate to biology.
* **Whole systems thinking**
    * Developed over the last 75 years (relative to 2015) to discover connectedness of things that seem to be unconnected
    * Tools for exploring wholeness & interrelatedness
   * The book is about a metascience, looking at parts of the world in a way that is unifying & explanatory.
    * Shows how to integrate knowledge of other sciences & provide them meaningful guidance.
* **Systems**
    * "Virtually everything in the universe, including the universe itself, is a system!"
    * Systems are composed of systems
    * Both fascinating & critical to our lives is understanding the world system, life system, and socioeconomic systems; we are participants in each of these systems.

# 1.2 The Distinctive Potential of Systems Science
* **Definition and Scope**
    * Systems science applies universally to everything in the universe.
    * It does not replace traditional scientific disciplines but offers a complementary approach.
* **Traditional Sciences vs. Systems Science**
    * **Traditional Sciences**
        * Specialize in specific fields and do not easily cross disciplinary boundaries.
        * Use reductionist approaches—breaking subjects into smaller parts for analysis.
        * Reconstruct whole systems from analyzed parts within a specific discipline.
    * **Systems Science**
        * Follows relational networks outward, leading to greater inclusivity.
        * Views boundaries as transitions to more comprehensive systemic levels.
        * Complements reductionist methods rather than replacing them.
        * Addresses complex multi-causal environmental and social problems.
* **Systems Science and Relationship Networks**
    * Every scientific discipline studies relationships within its subject matter.
    * Systems science focuses on the broader principles governing relational systems.
    * Interaction between systems science and specialized disciplines enhances understanding.
    * Disciplinary knowledge provides valuable insights that contribute to systems thinking.
* **Contribution of Systems Science**
    * Facilitates communication between highly specialized disciplines.
    * Functions like syntax in linguistics—revealing shared structures across diverse fields.
    * Bridges natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.
    * Helps address interdisciplinary challenges and complex systemic problems.
* **Nature of Systems Science**
    * Not a single, unified field but a collection of interrelated conceptual frameworks.
    * Aims to consolidate frameworks into a general theory of systems.
    * Provides scientific tools for studying natural objects as systems.


## 1.2.1 What Is a Science?
* **Definition of Science**
  * Science is more than just the scientific method—it is a way of thinking and understanding the universe.
  * It involves observation, curiosity, and speculation based on prior knowledge and discoveries.
  * Scientific inquiry is shaped by education and the cumulative work of previous scientists.
* **Scientific Method**
  * Formulating hypotheses based on informed speculation.
  * Designing and conducting controlled tests with measurements.
  * Using mathematical analysis, especially in the natural sciences.
  * Social sciences may use qualitative methods instead of quantitative ones.
  * The general public has limited experience with real scientific processes beyond basic school experiments.
* **Major Scientific Disciplines and Their Focus**
  * **Physics** – Studies matter/energy organization from cosmic to quantum levels.
  * **Chemistry** – Examines interactions between atoms and molecules, originating from stellar fusion.
  * **Biology** – Investigates dynamic interactions of living organisms.
  * **Ecology** – Focuses on the organization of life within ecosystems and the physical flows sustaining them.
  * **Social Sciences** – Explores human organizational complexity.
  * **Systems Science** – Examines relationships and organization across all levels of complexity.
* **Science as a Process**
  * Seeks to discover and codify how objects in the universe interact.
  * Objects studied must have some real embodiment, even if hidden (e.g., neural circuits for thoughts).
  * Observability and measurement allow repeatability, verification, and collective inquiry.
* **Mathematics and Science**
  * **Physics** is the most mathematically rigorous science, often seen as the "king" of sciences.
  * However, emergent complexity in chemistry, biology, and ecology introduces new dynamics.
  * No single scientific discipline should be taken as the model for all science. Different levels of complexity require appropriately tailored approaches.

## 1.2.2 What Is Systems Science?
* **Definition of Systems Science**
  * Encompasses all types of systems:  physical, biological, ecological, social, economic, etc.
  * Systems contain subsystems, which can be further analyzed into smaller units.
  * Every academic discipline studies systems within its domain.
* **Scope and Purpose**
  * Investigates the general attributes, dynamics, and behaviors of systems, rather than focusing on a single type.
  * Identifies **common features** across disciplines, rather than only differences.
  * Distinguishes different types of systems: **linear, nonlinear, closed, open, complex**, etc.
* **Historical Development**
  * Emerged from cybernetics, computers, information theory, and ecological sciences.
  * Has grown significantly over the last 40 years, influencing diverse fields.
  * Explored in various ways, including **mathematical models, computer simulations, philosophy, and ecology**.
* **Systems Theory and Its Evolution**
  * Focuses on **webs of relationships** rather than deterministic cause-effect chains.
  * Traditional mechanistic science emphasized **prediction and control**.
  * Modern systems science, influenced by **chaos theory and computing**, studies **emergence and unpredictability**.
* **Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)**
  * Systems that **learn from experience and adapt** over time.
  * Evolution, not machines, serves as the key paradigm.
  * Relevant to **computer science, ecosystems, cultures, and societies**.
* **Interdisciplinary Relevance**
  * Useful across **natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities**.
  * Key applications in **environmental science, sustainability, and human-nature interactions**.
  * Critical for addressing **global challenges**, particularly in the 21st century.
* **The Need for Systems Thinking**
  * Academic disciplines have traditionally been **separated**, but real-world systems are **interconnected**.
  * **Human actions impact the natural world, and vice versa**.
  * **Sustainability** is a major challenge requiring systems-informed thinking.
  * A **new paradigm** of interdisciplinary systems science is essential to addressing unintended consequences of past actions.

# 1.3 Systems Science as a Mode of Inquiry
* Views phenomena as a web of relationships among elements forming a system.
* Seeks common patterns, properties, and behaviors across different systems.
* Aims to identify universal principles applicable to all complex systems.
* Helps create a unified framework linking currently separate academic and scientific disciplines.

## 1.3.1 The Heritage of Atomism
* **Influence of Assumptions on Inquiry**
  * The questions we ask are shaped by **unexamined societal assumptions**.
  * Western thought emphasizes **individual units**, influencing beliefs about causation.
  * Example: **Blame-oriented thinking** in response to disasters (e.g., 9/11, Hurricane Katrina).
  * Individual responsibility, autonomy, and rights stem from this worldview.
* **Atomistic Thinking in Science**
  * Rooted in **ancient Greek philosophy**, reinforced by **17th-century science**.
  * Newtonian physics conceptualized the cosmos as a **vast machine**.
  * Scientific disciplines emerged to study **mechanisms** of various subsystems.
  * Assumption: The **whole** can be understood by **summing** the parts.
* **Limitations of Specialization**
  * Scientific fields became highly **specialized and fragmented**.
  * Reassembling knowledge across disciplines has become increasingly difficult.
  * The idea of fully reconstructing complex systems ("putting Humpty Dumpty back together") has largely been abandoned.

## 1.3.2 Holism
* **Holism vs. Atomism**
  * Holism prioritizes the **whole** as essential for understanding parts.
  * Rejects the idea that a whole is merely the **sum of its parts**.
  * Systems thinkers acknowledge part analysis but emphasize **interconnectedness**.
  * Elements in a system interact **synergistically**, not independently.
  * Context and relationships are **constitutive**, not just added complexity.
* **Example: Smoking as a Systemic Issue**
  * Traditional analysis: **Personal choice → smoking → health effects**.
  * Tobacco industry used this linear view to **shift responsibility to individuals**.
  * Systems analysis reveals a **complex web** of influences:
    * **Biology** – Teen brains aren’t fully developed for long-term decision-making.
    * **Social influence** – Peer pressure, media, and marketing shape choices.
    * **Corporate strategy** – Tobacco companies **target** teens and manipulate nicotine.
    * **Economic & policy factors** – Governments **tax** tobacco, creating financial dependence.
    * **Agriculture & environment** – Tobacco farming impacts soil, water, and economy.
    * **Healthcare & insurance** – Costs of smoking extend to medical care and risk management.
* **Implications of Systemic Thinking**
  * Linear analysis suggests **simple solutions** (e.g., anti-smoking campaigns).
  * Systemic view **expands intervention points** beyond individual choice.
  * Effective solutions require addressing **multiple interconnected factors**.
  * Every **relationship** in the system introduces new leverage points for change.

## 1.3.3 System Causal Dynamics
* **Systemic Gridlock and Stability**
  * Complex systems appear **interlocked**, making change seem impossible.
  * This interdependence also **stabilizes** systems, contributing to **resilience**.
  * Change often seems unlikely when viewed through **traditional causal models**.
* **Unexpected Systemic Shifts**
  * Large-scale societal changes—like smoking bans—are rarely predictable.
  * Linear cause-and-effect thinking struggles to explain **sudden transformations**.
  * Systems thinking must move beyond structure to focus on **process and change**.
* **Cybernetics and Feedback Loops**
  * **Cybernetics** (developed during WWII) revolutionized **causal thinking**.
  * Traditional causality assumes **fixed** sequences of actions.
  * **Feedback loops** allow systems to adjust dynamically—e.g., baking a cake requires real-time testing, not just a set timer.
  * In manufacturing, automation relies on **information feedback loops** for precise control.
* **Rethinking Causality**
  * Traditional models see causes as **one-directional** (A → B).
  * Systems thinking recognizes that **causes modify the system**, which then **alters future causes**.
  * Example: Carpet wear isn’t just **feet damaging carpet**—the carpet also **wears down shoes**.
  * Eric Sevareid’s insight: *"The chief cause of problems is solutions"*—changes in one part of a system often create **new, unforeseen issues**.
* **Key Takeaway**
  * Systems thinking **embraces process and feedback**, rather than static causality.
  * Understanding **dynamic relationships** helps explain **why and how** systems evolve over time.

## 1.3.4 Nonlinearity
#### **Dynamic Structure of Systems**  
- Systems inquiry examines how effects **circle back to influence their causes**, revealing the **dynamic structure** of systems.  
- Unlike the **predictable stability** of mechanical systems (e.g., water through pipes), complex systems can behave in **unexpected, nonlinear ways**.  

---

#### **Nonlinear Relationships and Thresholds**  
- In mechanical systems, **more input** generally leads to **predictable output** (e.g., pressing the gas pedal makes a car go faster).  
- In nonlinear systems, the relationship between cause and effect is **not proportional**:  
  - Doubling a medication dose does **not** necessarily double its effectiveness.  
  - Cooling water by one more degree can **transform it into ice**, representing a **systemic threshold** or **tipping point**.  
- Such thresholds lead to **disproportionate changes**, where **small inputs** can produce **major transformations**.  
  - Example: **Climate change**—a 4°C increase may lead to **radically different weather patterns**, not just slightly warmer temperatures.  

---

#### **Unpredictable Transformations**  
- In systems close to mechanical behavior (e.g., temperature changes), **transformations** from small inputs can be **unexpected**.  
- In **social systems**, however, sudden changes (e.g., **revolutions, economic bubbles**) are more familiar.  
  - Example: **Cigarette smoking** in American society transformed rapidly from being advertised as healthy to being heavily restricted.  
- In **ecosystems**, interventions can trigger **cascading changes** with far-reaching consequences.  
- **Systems inquiry** seeks to uncover **patterns and principles** that explain how complex, dynamic behaviors emerge from seemingly predictable physical systems.  

---

#### **Systems Dynamics and Chaos Theory**  
- **Systems dynamics** studies how **systems change over time**.  
- In engineered systems (e.g., computers), pathways are designed for **predictable information processing**, but **feedback loops** can introduce **surprises**.  
  - **Chaos theory**: Discovered that **simple nonlinear equations**, when repeated many times, produce **complex, unpredictable patterns**.  
    - These patterns often resemble **natural forms** (e.g., tree leaves, flowers) with **self-similarity** but no exact repetition.  
    - This discovery echoed **Galileo’s idea** that mathematics underlies the universe, suggesting that **nonlinear mathematics** is fundamental to nature.  

---

#### **From Order to Complexity**  
- Traditional linear mathematics struggled with **turbulence**, aiming to simplify it for calculation.  
- Systems inquiry **reframes turbulence** as a shift from **simple to complex order**, revealing deeper dynamic relationships.  
  - Example: **Laminar flow of water** transforms into **turbulent flow** at a certain rate, showing a sudden increase in complexity.  
- **Illya Prigogine’s work** on **far-from-equilibrium dissipative systems** explained how systems **self-organize** from energy flows, earning him the **Nobel Prize in 1977**.  
  - This showed how **order and complexity** can arise **spontaneously** in dynamic systems, a concept **Stuart Kauffman** called "**order-for-free**."  
  - These insights **span multiple disciplines**, from **physics and chemistry** to **biology and ecology**, showing the **unifying power of systems inquiry**.  

---

#### **Crossing Disciplinary Boundaries**  
- Systems inquiry crosses traditional boundaries, using **relational concepts** that apply across diverse topics.  
- **Prigogine’s discoveries** began in physics, extended to chemistry, and informed **biology**, showing that all living organisms are **dissipative systems**.  
  - Example: The **Earth and its ecosystems** are **far-from-equilibrium systems** continuously **absorbing and transforming solar energy**.  
- This cross-disciplinary approach **avoids reductionism**, embracing the **emergence of complexity** at each new level of organization:  
  - Physical → Chemical → Biological → Social.  
  - It anticipates an ongoing narrative of **emergent complexity** rather than reducing everything to **physics or mechanics**.  

---

#### **Feedback Loops and Emergent Behavior**  
- **Feedback loops** allow systems thinkers to model **dynamic processes and change** beyond **linear causality**.  
  - Effects can **circle back** to influence their own causes, creating **interwoven networks** of influence.  
  - Example: **Smoking regulation** led to new levels of **government enforcement**, affecting **industries** (vending machines declined, counter sales grew).  
- **Feedback complexity** challenges **predictability** but prompts **better questions** and **deeper insights**.  
  - Example: **SUV rollovers** are linked not just to physics (high center of gravity) but to **social perceptions** of ruggedness, influenced by advertising.  
- As complexity grows, **predictability decreases**, but systems inquiry provides a **holistic framework** to understand **emergent phenomena**.  
  - It suggests an approach of **cautious adaptability**, much like the **Taoist principle**:  
    - "The sage is cautious and alert, like one crossing a river in winter" (*Tao te Ching*, Chap. 15).
